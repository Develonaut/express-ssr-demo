    <p>
      This Cookie Policy describes the practices concerning the information
      collected by Polarity Technologies Ltd (“Polarity, &#34;we&#34;,
      &#34;us&#34; and &#34;our&#34;) in connection with the use of cookies
      and all similar technologies on the websites, applications, and Services
      controlled by Polarity (the &#34;Products&#34;).
    </p>
    <p>
      We use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, mobile device IDs and similar
      files or technologies to collect and store the information we
      automatically collect about your computer, device, and Product usage. We
      use the term &#34;cookies&#34; in this policy to refer to cookies and
      all such similar technologies that collect information automatically
      when you are using the Polarity Services, where this policy is posted.
      You can find out more about cookies and how to control them in the
      information below.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not accept the use of these cookies, please disable them using
      the instructions in this cookie policy, by following the
      &#39;opt-out&#39; links provided below or by changing your br/owser
      settings so that cookies from the Products cannot be placed on your
      computer or mobile device.
    </p>
    <h3>1. What is a cookie?</h3>
    <p>
      Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are
      downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a certain
      webpage. Cookies are then sent back to the originating webpage on each
      subsequent visit, or to another webpage that recognizes that cookie.
      Cookies are widely used in order to make Polarity Products work, or to
      work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners
      of a website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between
      pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving
      the user experience. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have
      visited the Polarity Services before or whether you are a new visitor.
      They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more
      relevant to you and your interests.
    </p>
    <p>There are two br/oad categories of cookies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile
        device.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third party cookies, which are served by a third party. We use third
        party cookies for functionality, performance / analytics, advertising
        (including to target ads to you) and social media purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different
      periods of time. Some cookies are &#39;session cookies&#39;, meaning
      that they exist only while your br/owser is open. These are deleted
      automatically once you close your br/owser. Other cookies are
      &#39;permanent cookies&#39;, meaning that they survive after your
      br/owser is closed. They can be used by Polarity Services to recognize
      your computer when you open your br/owser and br/owse the Internet
      again.
